- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?


The provided code has a NoSQL injection vulnerability in the /userinfo route where user input (id from req.query) is used directly in a MongoDB query without proper validation or sanitization. 
This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to inject malicious code into the query, potentially allowing them to access or manipulate data in the database.
In the secure version, there's a check to ensure the id follows the expected format (a 24-character hexadecimal string, which is the format of MongoDB ObjectIds). 
This helps ensure that only properly formatted IDs are passed to the database query, mitigating the risk of injection.
To further enhance security, using prepared statements or similar mechanisms can prevent injection by separating the query structure from its data.
